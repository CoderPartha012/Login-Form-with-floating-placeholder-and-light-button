Login Form with floating placeholder

This is an HTML and CSS code for a user-friendly login  form. The form consists of two input fields, one for the username and the other for the password. The form is contained in a login-box div which has been styled using CSS to have a gradient background color, a box shadow, and rounded corners. The form fields have been styled to have a bottom border that changes color and moves up when the field is in focus or has content entered. The login button is styled to have a hover effect that creates a gradient background, changes text color, and adds a box shadow with multiple layers. The effect is achieved using CSS animations on the span elements nested within the anchor tag.
